        **Thanks for your interest to ZIP Lab**

        *To be eligible for PhD positions @ Monash Uni, applicants must have published at least 1-2 first-author top-tier papers in ML/NLP/CV venues.* 
        
        The principles of lab:

        1. Personal Endeavor: Undertaking a PhD is a deeply personal journey.
        
        2. Research Freedom: We uphold research freedom as a fundamental principle, with no fixed working or resting hours.
        
        3. Weekly Meetings: Attendance at weekly one-on-one meetings with me is mandatory. Reports can be formatted freely but must adhere to standard content guidelines.
        
        4. Active Engagement: Actively participate in group or subgroup discussions, and familiarize yourself with shared papers and projects.
        
        5. Timely Draft Submission: Submit the full draft to me at least 7 days prior to the submission deadline.
        
        6. Funding Proposal Writing: PhD, Master, and Bachelor students are NOT expected to draft funding proposals, as the program is purely research-based.
        
        7. Active Conference Participation: Engage in international conferences to build connections, and consider organizing or attending international tutorials and workshops.
        
        8.  Thesis Requirements: The final PhD thesis does not need to be publication-based, and there are no specific requirements for the number of papers for graduation. Focus on quality over quantity.
        
        9.  Internships and Visits: We encourage pursuing internships in industry (e.g., Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta) or visiting internationally renowned institutions, while adhering to internship policies.
        
        10. Timely Graduation: Students are encouraged to graduate as early as possible.
